# No-Show Appointments Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on understanding the factors influencing patients missing their medical appointments. The project utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn to perform comprehensive data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

### Features

**Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering out irrelevant information.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical summaries and data visualization to uncover patterns and insights.

**Visualization:** Use of Matplotlib and seaborn to create informative and interactive plots.

**Insights:** Identifying key factors that contribute to missed appointments, such as patient demographics, appointment times, and external factors.

### Tools and Libraries

**NumPy:** For numerical operations and efficient data manipulation.

**Pandas:** For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

**Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

**Seaborn:** For statistical data visualization, making plots more attractive and informative.
